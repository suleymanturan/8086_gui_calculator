# 8086_gui_calculator

WHAT?

    This is a simple (for modern standards) calculator program for Intel 8086 CPU with a horrendous gui.
WHY?

    It started as a university assignment, then transformed into an interesting project, finally become a pain in the eyes.
HOW?

    It parses input expression, converts it to Reverse Polish Notation and after solving it displays the result on its glorious UI.
WHERE?

    It can be assembled by masm611 and can be used in DOSBOX or other emulation software (Please get a real calculator).
WHEN?

    It is born when i was in university, it died after i passed the class. It resurrected when i stumbled upon it on my old rusty harddrive (What is git?).
WHO?

    I am (SÃ¼leyman Turan) its (not so proud) parent.
